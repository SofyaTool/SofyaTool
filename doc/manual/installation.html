<p>Use of &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; is governed by the
<a href="../../LICENSE-1.0">University of Nebraska Open Academic License</a>.
You must read and accept all of the terms and conditions of this license prior
to downloading, installing and/or using the software.
</p>
<p>The current version of &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; can be downloaded here:
<a href="http://cse.unl.edu/~galileo/ltd-tools">SIR Tools</a>
</p>
<p>The &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; Java analysis system is written entirely in Java,
so it is theoretically possible to install and run the system on any architecture
for which the Java2 SDK/JRE version 1.5 or greater is available. The system has
been extensively tested on Solaris (SunOS), SuSE Linux 9.1, and to a lesser extent on
Red Hat Linux 9.0, Fedora Core 4, Gentoo 2006.0, and Windows 2000/XP.
Most recently, we have had some success running &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;
on Java 1.7, but complete compatibility is not guaranteed due to continuing
changes to the JVM and class file header formats.<p>

<p>This software requires a library called BCEL which can be downloaded

<a href="http://sofya.unl.edu/files/bcel-5.2.tar.gz">here</a>.  Earlier versions of
<!-- <a href="../../files/bcel-5.2.tar.gz">here</a>.  Earlier versions of -->
&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; were not packaged with this library included
however the latest &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; version (2.1.7) uses BCEL
6.0 which is included within the  &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; package,
or the jar can be downloaded <a href="../../files/bcel-6.0.jar">here.</a>.
</p>
<p>Do the following to install &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;.</p>

<h3>Install &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Choose where to extract the &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; system. On extraction,
       a directory called "sofya" will be created in this location.</li>
   <li>Unzip the package using gunzip: <code>gunzip sofya.tar.gz</code></li>
   <li>Extract the resulting archive: <code>tar -xvf sofya.tar</code></li>
   <li>Alternatively, you can do the unzip and extract in a single command:
       <code>tar --gunzip -xvf sofya.tar.gz</code></li>
   <li>All the files should be extracted into subdirectories in the &quot;sofya&quot; directory. This directory
       is the root directory for the entire  &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; system.</li>
   <li>Create a directory named &quot;.sofyadb&quot; in your home directory. This will act as the database
       for &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;, where it will store most of its outputs.</li>
   <li>Add the location of &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; to your Java classpath. Suppose you
       extracted &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; into a directory named &quot;tools&quot; in your
       home directory. Then you would execute the following command (in csh/tcsh):
       <p><code>setenv CLASSPATH &quot;${CLASSPATH}&quot;:${HOME}/tools/sofya/sofya.jar</code></p>
       You may prefer to add this to your classpath in your shell's startup script.</li>
   <li>Add the supporting libraries required by  &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; to your classpath:
       <p><code>setenv CLASSPATH &quot;${CLASSPATH}&quot;:${HOME}/tools/sofya/lib/commons-collections.jar:${HOME}/tools/sofya/lib/trove/lib/trove.jar:${HOME}/tools/sofya/lib/bcel-6.0.jar</code>
       </p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Install BCEL</h3>
<p>If you have downloaded version Sofya 2.1.7, the bcel 6.0 beta version is provided within
the <i>sofya/lib</i> directory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Include the <b>sofya/lib/bcel-6.0.jar</b> file on you classpath, assuming that you unzipped sofya into your ${HOME}/tools directory (in csh/tcsh):
<p><code>setenv CLASSPATH &quot;${CLASSPATH}&quot;:${HOME}/tools/sofya/lib/bcel-6.0.jar</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have downloaded an earlier Sofya version (prior to version 2.1.7) follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose where to extract the BCEL system</li>
  <li>Unzip the package using gunzip: <code>gunzip bcel-5.2.tar.gz</code></li>
  <li>Extract the resulting archive: <code>tar -xvf bcel-5.2.tar</code></li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can unzip and extract by the single command:
      <code>tar --gunzip -xvf bcel-5.2.tar.gz</code></li>
  <li>All the files should be extracted into subdirectories in the &quot;bcel-5.2&quot; directory.
      This directory is the root directory for the BCEL library.</li>
  <li>Add the location of the BCEL library to your Java classpath. Suppose you extracted BCEL
      into your home directory. Then you would execute the following command (in csh/tcsh):
      <p><code>setenv CLASSPATH &quot;${CLASSPATH}&quot;:${HOME}/bcel-5.2/bcel-5.2.jar</code></p>
      If you instead downloaded the BCEL 6.0 jar, you would put it on your
      Java classpath, replacing the ${HOME}/bcel-5.2/bcel-5.2.jar portion
      with the path to where you placed the BCEL 6.0 jar.
      You may prefer to add this to your classpath in your shell's startup script.</li>
</ol>
